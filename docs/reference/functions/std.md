# Function std

Compute the standard deviation of a list of values, defined as the
square root of the variance: std(A) = sqrt(var(A)).
In case of a (multi dimensional) array or matrix, the standard deviation
over all elements will be calculated.

    std(a, b, c, ...)
    std(A)
    std(A, normalization)

Where `normalization` is a string having one of the following values:


### Parameters

Parameter | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
`array` | Array &#124; Matrix | A single matrix or or multiple scalar values
`normalization` | String |  Default value: 'unbiased' Determines how to normalize the standard deviation: - 'unbiased' (default) The sum of squared errors is divided by (n - 1) - 'uncorrected'        The sum of squared errors is divided by n - 'biased'             The sum of squared errors is divided by (n + 1)

### Returns
